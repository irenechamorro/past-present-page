    <p> The purpose of this project was to emulate the style of a chosen past designer, in</p>
    <p>this case William Morris, and modernize it. In this group project we made a series of</p>
    <p>designed objects and a setting that was stylized with modern techniques, while keeping   </p>
    <p> aspects of Art Nouveau. I had the role of creating a wallpaper and design that would  </p>
    <p>be applied to different objects, as well as creating an ad for the fictional company</p>
    <p>that would sell these objects.</p>

    <p> To keep in line with the Art Nouveau style I chose to draw decorative, thin flowers</p>
    <p> in very neutral colors, as William Morris used. The modernity comes out in the placement </p>
    <p> of the large repetitive print that is often used in minimalist interior design that has </p>
    <p> been very popular in recent years. </p>

    <p> This teacup set is an example of the kind of products this fusion design company would</p>
    <p> sell. The print of the cup and plate are floral and delicate, whereas the form of the  </p>
    <p> product is very simple and uncomplicated, with the cup possibly being made of plastic</p>
    <p> or another mordern material used to make everyday tableware.  </p>

    <p> The poster was made to encapsulate the style of the company, Ornaments and Elgance, and </p>
    <p> was used to advertize a fictional exhibition of the products we created with the William</p>
    <p> Morris style in mind. The poster itself has a delicate flowery design around the text </p>
    <p> banner, and is a beige color that displays age and wealth, appealing to an audience that</p>   
    <p> would enjoy modernized Art Nouveau products. The font choice was the most difficult part </p>
    <p> of this project, as I wanted to keep in mind all the different style elements at play. I</p>
    <p> tried drawing out the lettering, and then experimented with some existing fonts. Eventually,</p>
    <p> I used a combination of those two techniques and finished with the poster above. </p>
